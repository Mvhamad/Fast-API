## Project Description

Fast-API is a lightweight web application framework built on top of Python's asynchronous capabilities. This project serves as a simple yet effective demonstration of how to set up a RESTful API using FastAPI. The application is designed to be fast, efficient, and easy to use, making it a great choice for developers looking to build APIs quickly.

### Key Features
- Asynchronous support for high performance
- Easy to use and learn, with clear documentation
- Automatic generation of OpenAPI documentation
- Simple integration with various database systems (not included in this demo)
